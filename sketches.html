    <h2 id="head1">Sketch 1</h2>
    <p id="bodyp1">This sketch was the base for my 6th sketch. I found it was too vibrant and wasn't giving me the desired effect.</p>
    <iframe id="sk2" src="https://editor.p5js.org/mary.rochon/full/AavuMq6xy" width="1000px" height="1042px"></iframe>
    <h2 id="head2">Sketch 2</h2>
    <p id="bodyp2">This was a sketch made in class where the mouse changes the colour of the canvas. As much as I thought this would be a cool background, it makes other interactive elements a bit awkward.</p>
    <iframe id="sk3" src="https://editor.p5js.org/mary.rochon/full/ZZo4ZkjLT" width="1000px" height="1042px"></iframe>
    <h2 id="head3">Sketch 3</h2>
    <p id="bodyp3">This was a failed loop constanting of s', that I thought would be cool if the curve of the loop may make the s. This did not work out.</p>
    <iframe id="sk4" src="https://editor.p5js.org/mary.rochon/full/8RfEE7Leh" width="1000px" height="1042px"></iframe>
    <h2 id="head4">Sketch 4</h2>
    <p id="bodyp4">In this sketch I was having fun with the slider, while exploring light. However when I went to add the text with the orbit control I found that the text would move with the form. Plus if I put the text in the setup function it gets covered. So this one didn't work out.</p>
    <iframe id="sk5"src="https://editor.p5js.org/mary.rochon/full/RhK9mthYm" width="1000px" height="1042px"></iframe>
    <h2 id="head5">Sketch 5</h2>
    <p id="bodyp5">Again this is from an in class tutorial where we were exploring fountains. Though this sketch isn't exciting, it gave me the idea for my 19th sketch.</p>
    <iframe id="sk6"src="https://editor.p5js.org/mary.rochon/full/BlMpu88S3" width="1000px" height="1042px"></iframe>
    <h2 id="head6">Sketch 6</h2>
    <p id="bodyp6">I wanted to experiment with text, as I don't use it much, or at all in my sketchs. However this piece was too boring to be including with the other 21 sketches.</p>
    <img id="sk7" src="images/flower.png">
    <h2 id="head7">Sketch 7</h2>
    <p id="bodyp7">This piece was a 30min CSS sketch of a flower in class. Clearly it is incompleted. However my true intention was to depict the each petal of the flower, which was a huge mistake as it would take me longer.</p>
